# Human Development Index

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index

From Wikipedia:
> The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income per capita indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development.

I want to develop graphics showing the Human Development Index (HDI) over time, and also potentially graph the HDI against other data like inequality-adjusted HDI; population over time; Gross Domestic Product (GDP), both per capita and by Purchasing Power Parity; and perhaps even against items like the Big Mac Index.

We'll see how far this goes.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

**This project is going to use Packrat for R package management. So it's got extra directories and all the packages are maintained there for reproducibility. This is normally overkill but I wanted to practice on that, too.**

## File list

 * **Human development index (HDI).csv** : The raw data, downloaded from the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Reports (http://hdr.undp.org/en/data)
 * **WPP2015_POP_F01_1_TOTAL_POPULATION_BOTH_SEXES.xls** : Raw data for United Nations World Population Prospects.
