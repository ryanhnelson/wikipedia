# Wikipedia Projects

Miscellaneous projects I see and think of based on Wikipedia. This could mean many different things: cleaning or improving charts I see, trying to develop new analyses, or trying to improve statistics I see (or find new things for myself).

Overall, this repo is for me to practice and increase my skills, and I hope to use both R (with libraries like ggplot2) and Python (with libraries like pandas and matplotlib) to improve.
